"""Thin wrapper that imports symbols from the compiled extension.

Keeping this in a separate module makes it easy to:
  * stub the imports out in tests if the extension is not built,
  * add Pythonic conveniences (``__repr__``, helper classmethods, etc.)
    around the native classes without polluting the binding C++ code.
